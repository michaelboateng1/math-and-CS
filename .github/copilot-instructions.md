# AI Agent Instructions for Algebra Project

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based Jupyter notebook project focused on mathematical concepts in algebra, particularly ratio and proportion. The project uses interactive notebooks for mathematical exploration and education.

## Project Structure

- `ratioAndProportion.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing ratio and proportion concepts
- Project is organized as standalone notebooks for different algebraic topics

## Development Environment

- Python Jupyter notebook environment
- Key dependencies: Python mathematics libraries (to be specified in notebooks)

## Working with Notebooks

- Each notebook is self-contained with its own dependencies and setup
- Code cells should include clear markdown documentation of mathematical concepts
- Use proper mathematical notation in markdown cells when explaining formulas
- Include practical examples and visualizations where applicable

## Code Style and Patterns

- Write clear, educational code that demonstrates mathematical concepts
- Include step-by-step explanations in markdown cells
- Document mathematical assumptions and limitations
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect mathematical terms

## Building and Running

1. Ensure Python and Jupyter environments are properly configured
2. Dependencies should be installed per notebook requirements
3. Execute cells sequentially to maintain proper state
4. Include validation cells to verify mathematical results

## Best Practices

- Begin each notebook with setup and import cells
- Include markdown cells explaining theoretical concepts
- Provide example problems and solutions
- Use visualization cells to illustrate mathematical relationships
- Include exercises or practice problems where appropriate

## Testing and Validation

- Include test cases with known mathematical results
- Verify calculations against standard mathematical properties
- Document edge cases and boundary conditions
